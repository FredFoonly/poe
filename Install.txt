To install Poe, edit the Makefile.inc file, and change the PROFILE 
variable to either debug or release, and change the PREFIX_RELEASE and 
PREFIX_DEBUG variables to the location where you would like to install it 
to.  

Then from a shell enter

     make
     make install
     make clean

Testing and development is still ongoing when I get the time.  Some 
features are not yet designed, much less implemented.  In particular 
profile files which will be different from PE2, and undo which will be 
very different from both PE2 and other traditional editors and hopefully a 
lot less annoying to use than the traditional undo/redo stack.  There is a 
manual in progress.  I haven't started on the man page yet - it will 
be a cut-down version of the manual, and will mostly cover the 
as-yet-unimplemeented profile system.

POE has been tested on OpenBSD on the Intel x64 processor.  There are 
many OpenBSD-isms in the codebase.  

My priority for porting is:  
     FreeBSD x64
     Mac OS X
     Linux x64
     Linux Raspberry Pi.
