To install Poe, cd to either the bsd or linux directory as
appropriate, then edit the Makefile.inc file, and change the PROFILE
variable to either debug or release, and change the PREFIX_RELEASE and
PREFIX_DEBUG variables to the location where you would like to install
it to.

Then from a shell enter

     make
     make install
     make clean

Testing and development is still ongoing when I get the time.  Some
features are not yet designed, much less implemented.  At the moment
profile files are similar to PE2, but this is unlikely to persist.
Undo is currently pretty much nonexistent, and I'm hoping that the
eventual implementation will be very different from both PE2 and other
traditional editors and hopefully a lot less annoying to use than the
traditional undo/redo stack.

OpenBSD x64 is the primary development target, though POE has been
tested on OpenBSD (x64, GCC) and FreeBSD (x64, CLANG), and Linux
(Debian/Raspbian Raspberry 2; Ubuntu Vivid Vervet x64 GCC; Slackware
14.1 x64 GCC).

My priority for future ports:
   Mac OS X
   Microsoft Windows
